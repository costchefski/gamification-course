## Basic Game Ingredients

### My questions

* What are the rules?
* What is the win condition?
* What does "getting it right" look like?
* What are the ways to "get it wrong"?
* What's the level of difficulty / challenge / uncertain outcome which leads to a state of focus? (also, citation needed on the focus studies)

## The Gameplay Loop

### My questions

* What are my gameplay loop elements?
* What are the placeholder events?
* What are the limitations / options within the events?
* Is there enough variance when the loop repeats?

## Intro to Macrostructure

### My questions

* What's the immediate / intermediate / ultimate goal?
* How can I make sure my learners get multiple simultaneous goals to motivate them?
* How will I structure these goals to unlock / progress learners achievements?

## How Games Teach

### My questions

* How can my project make learning feel like not learning, but "leveling up"?
* How can I make learners feel it was their own idea/motivation which progresses them?
* How can my project use "Isolate" & "Forced Success" to make learners feel confidence and progress early on?
* How much practice do I want to give them later, and how will I simplify things, until they reach mastery?
* How will I make sure that learners are immediately, constantly active?
* How much freedom will I give the learner to find the best strategies?
* How will I evaluate learners from the start to make sure that failure registers as useful immediate constant feedback?
* Teach + test = game challenge

## Intro to Active Learning

### My questions

* How can I use socratic strings to lead learners through puzzles even though they may not 100% all know them?
* How will I split the content into known/unknown, and guessable/non-guessable?
* How will I phrase instructions / questions to make the knowns/guessables actually guessable?
* How will I reinforce the freshly added "knowns" to structure later learning?
